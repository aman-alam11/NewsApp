# NewsApp
A combined news app giving news from the leading newspapers of different countries

Countries Supported for Now and I plan to pull data from :

1. US (New York Times https://developer.nytimes.com)
2. UK (The Guardian http://open-platform.theguardian.com/)
3. India (Not Finalized Yet)
4. Canada (Not Finalized Yet)


Plans: Right Now the app is in very initial stage. It opens up with 4 buttons each 
with a country name and leading to the data provided by that API. However this is 
just the initial setup. I plan to replace it with a scrollable tab and plan to expand it
to different countries (France and Germany). I haven't included them currently because of 
the language issues as their leading newspapers will be in French and Deutsch.
